## Flutter Testing

### Why do we write tests?

### Why should we test?

- Talk with your team and define your own testing pyramid, for example: Quantity of tests from high(bottom) to low(top).
  1. Integration:
     1. Low amount of tests
     2. Test a complete process of your app
     3. Hard to write and long execution time
     4. Examples:
        1. Make a deposit of your banking account
        2. Create an account of your social media app
        3. Helpful link: [https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook/testing/integration/introduction](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook/testing/integration/introduction)
  2. UI Golden Tests:
     1. Medium amount of tests
     2. Compares the current UI of your app with a defined image of this UI
     3. Not so hard to write and medium execution time
     4. Examples:
        1. Are all button state being as we expect them

  3. UI Widget Tests:
     1. Medium amount of tests
     2. Tests a UI component and the different states of it without business logic
     3. Not so hard to write and medium execution time
     4. Examples:
        1. Shows my UI a reloading spinner after a pull to refresh

  4. Business Logic(Unit/BLoC)
